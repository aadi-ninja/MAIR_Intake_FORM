---

### **3.3 Status Management**

Each request must maintain lifecycle state including:

* Submitted
* Acknowledged
* In Review

* In Progress
* Completed

The system automatically updates status based on workflow actions .

Each update must:

* Be stored with timestamp

---

### **3.4 Request Viewing & Dashboard**

* Filter & sort

Admins / Developers can:

* Manage system queue
  (Defined in requirement) 

---

### **3.5 Approval Workflow**

Workflow must support:
1️⃣ User submits request
2️⃣ Leadership automatically notified
3️⃣ Leadership reviews feasibility
4️⃣ Leadership triggers approval workflow to designated approvers
5️⃣ Approvers:

* Approve
* Reject
* Request More Info
  6️⃣ Status automatically updates

Routing uses **stored user & role data** 

---

### **3.6 Comments / Collaboration**

Each request has a **threaded comment section**, like Azure DevOps:

* Users and approvers can post comments
* Comments should appear chronologically
* Replies supported
* Stored in DB
* Viewable in request detail page
  (Tagging not included in MVP but system should be designed to support future tagging) 

---

### **3.7 Prioritization**

System must support **WSJF Prioritization**

* Capture required WSJF inputs
* Auto compute score
* Display ranking
  Requirement explicitly stated 

---

## **4. Technology Requirements**

### **4.1 Frontend**

* Angular
  (Required) 

### **4.2 Backend**

## **6. Out of Scope (MVP)**

As explicitly mentioned:

* User tagging in comments

* Advanced analytics or reporting beyond basic prioritization and statuses 

---

## **7. Assumptions**

* Required user & role data exists in database
* Workflow may evolve but core MVP remains same
* Compliance & security will follow org standards 

---

## **8. Acceptance Criteria**

A successful MVP must:
✔ Allow users to submit 3 request types
✔ Dynamically change form fields
✔ Store requests in DB
✔ Maintain status lifecycle
✔ Support approval workflow
✔ Provide dashboard views
✔ Allow threaded comments
✔ Implement WSJF
✔ Work on Angular + Python + MSSQL stack

---

## **9. Future Enhancements**

(Not part of MVP but possible roadmap)

* User mentions / tagging in comments
* Email notifications
* SLA tracking
